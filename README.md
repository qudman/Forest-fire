# Forest Fires

I intend to use 3 different tools to predict the burned area of forest fires, in the northeast region of Portugal
1. Decision Tree Regressor
2. Random Forest
3. XGBoost

Since our dataset follows a regression problem, RMSE will be used to estimate the prefered model. The lower the RMSE, the better.


**My motivation for working on this dataset is to continually improve my machine learning skills**
